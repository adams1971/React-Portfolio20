# Description

## React Portfolio

## This is the third version of my professional portfolio this time built using React. The user can move quickly from page to page and view content without loading a new page via the use of React Router. It showcases many of my project applications build while attending the UW Wed Dev Boot Camp. The first 3 projects on the portfolio page are team projects, the remaining are solo projects.
